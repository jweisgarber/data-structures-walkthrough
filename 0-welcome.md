# I. Welcome - Data Structures
This will be a tutorial to help introduce you to some of the many data structures
available in C# and many other programming languages. Here we will go over what
each data structure is and a real world problem in which the data structure can
be used to help solve the problem. In this tutorial we will specifically cover Stacks,
Sets, and Trees. There is a section for each data structure. Have Fun!
